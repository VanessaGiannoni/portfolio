# Vanessa Giannoni - Portfolio

## About Me

I'm Vanessa Giannoni, a Software Engineer with a passion for communication and teamwork. Over the years, I've had the pleasure of working on a variety of exciting projects for companies like GSK, McCormick, HP, and Trupanion, as well as some interesting internal projects.

As a full-stack engineer who loves focusing on the frontend, I always strive to deliver projects that are accessible and inclusive, adhering to WCAG and A11Y standards. Writing clean, clear, and scalable code is a priority for me.

What I truly enjoy is being part of a team. I'm very communicative and believe in maintaining a healthy, relaxed atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable sharing their knowledge. Helping others grow and succeed is incredibly rewarding, and I love seeing my teammates thrive.

I also enjoy sharing my knowledge through writing technical posts, sharing my development journey, giving talks, and mentoring. In 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to mentor a talented team of girls at Technovation Floripa, and it was such a fulfilling experience.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me studying Go/Baduk (an Asian board game), solving puzzles, watching movies and series, or simply enjoying a good cup of coffee or chimarr√£o with my family.

## Projects

### Trupanion

The project consisted of three different management platforms, a registration and sales website for pet life insurance, and the Back-end For Front-end (BFF) project. My work went far beyond development, as I worked on all sides, I needed flexibility, adaptation, and much communication to be able to carry out the different tasks. In addition to working at all ends, I helped fellow developers at all levels and project managers to deliver a product within accessibility standards (AA) and with maximum quality and scalability.

- **Stacks**: TypeScript, Jest, Node.js, Zod, Mantine, Git, Azure, Next.js, CSS-in-JS, BFF, SCRUM, Server-side rendering (SSR)

### Zoho People

In my first internal project within the company, I was able to explore new horizons and had the freedom to choose the technology that best suited the situation. What started as a small migration that would use Zoho People's HR management system API, ended up becoming something bigger. The idea was to migrate the spreadsheet system to the new platform, so I needed to be side by side with the client to understand their pain and be able to adapt a Python script so that they could download and upload the information on the requested platform, in addition, I took the opportunity to add some tests using PyTest and thus increase the code quality.

- **Stacks**: Python3, PyTest, Pandas, Google Sheets API

### HP One

During my time at HP, I had the opportunity to work in two different teams. The first team focused on creating a micro-frontend (MFE) orchestrator so HP's development team could add new MFE projects in different technologies alongside legacy projects. In this team, I focused on documenting and mapping the project for new developers who would use the tool. In the second team, I focused on developing a platform for controlling the plans users would access when they subscribed to the HP One service. This team focused on developing micro-frontends in ReactJS and TypeScript.

- **Stacks**: React.js, Jest, TypeScript, Babel, Git, Github, SCRUM, Documentation, Docker

### McCormick - Super Bowl Bonecoin

The aim of this project was to go live during the Super Bowl in the United States and Canada. The main idea was that users could take photos of chicken wing bones and turn them into coins, and at the end of the competition whoever had the most coins could exchange them for a prize. This project was developed as a web app for cell phone and tablet browsers only. The technologies used for development were ReactJS and Typescript.

- **Stacks**: TypeScript, CSS-in-JS, SCSS

### GSK - Think Tank Challenge

The project consisted of a static website developed in VUE with only one form to receive user registrations. The target the future website provides information on multiple myeloma and encourages patients to share their stories in order to promote scientific research into this rare cancer.

- **Stacks**: VUE.js, Nuxt.js, Sass, JavaScript, Client-side rendering, Git, Github
